Text to speech for Kodi (XBMC)
------------------------------
Adds speech to Kodi. It does this by using the available speech engines for the particular platform, and aims to
work 'out of the box' as much as possible.

For a thesis, I'm adding support for splitting music and speech output to different sound devices.
Currently, as a proof of principle, I develop for ArchLinux, speech enginge eSpeak, pipe to aplay.

Installation should be done through Kodi System::Settings::Add-ons::Get Add-Ons::All Add-Ons::Services::XBMC TTS

If you want to ensure you are using the latest version of the addon you can install ruuk's [repository .zip file](http://ruuks-repo.googlecode.com/files/ruuk.addon.repository-1.0.0.zip).
